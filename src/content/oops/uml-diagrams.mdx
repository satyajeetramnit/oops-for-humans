# UML Diagrams

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  UML (Unified Modeling Language) is like **Architectural Blueprints**:
  
  Before building a skyscraper, you draw plans.
  - **Class Diagram**: The floor plan (Structure).
  - **Sequence Diagram**: The script of a play (Interactions).
  - **Use Case Diagram**: The menu of services (Functionality).

### Key Concepts

1.  **Class Diagram**: Shows classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.
    - Static view of the system.
    - Uses boxes and arrows.

2.  **Sequence Diagram**: Shows how objects interact over time.
    - Dynamic view.
    - Uses lifelines (vertical lines) and messages (horizontal arrows).

3.  **Use Case Diagram**: Shows what the system does for the user (Actors).
    - Functional view.
    - Uses stick figures and ovals.

### Why use UML?
- **Communication**: A picture is worth 1000 lines of code.
- **Planning**: Catch design flaws before coding.
- **Documentation**: Help new developers understand the system.
