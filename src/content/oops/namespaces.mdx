# Namespaces (Packages)

<AnalogyBox type="folder">
  Namespaces are like **Folders on your Computer**:
  
  You can have a file named `Resume.docx` in your "Work" folder AND in your "Personal" folder. They don't conflict because they are in different **Namespaces**.
  
  Without folders, you'd have to name them `Work_Resume.docx` and `Personal_Resume.docx`. Messy!
</AnalogyBox>

## Why use Packages?

1.  **Avoid Naming Conflicts**: Two libraries can both have a `User` class if they are in different packages.
2.  **Organization**: Group related classes together (e.g., `java.util` for utilities, `java.io` for input/output).
3.  **Access Control**: `protected` members are only visible to classes in the *same* package.

## The Code

### Java (Packages)
```java
// File: src/com/myapp/users/User.java
package com.myapp.users;

public class User {
    // ...
}
```

```java
// File: src/com/myapp/Main.java
package com.myapp;

import com.myapp.users.User; // Import to use

class Main {
    User u = new User();
}
```

### C# (Namespaces)
```csharp
namespace MyApp.Users {
    public class User {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Python (Modules)
Every file is a module.
```python
# File: users.py
class User:
    pass

# File: main.py
from users import User
u = User()
```
