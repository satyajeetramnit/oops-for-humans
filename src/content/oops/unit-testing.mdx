# Unit Testing

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  Unit Testing is like **Quality Control in a Factory**:
  
  Before a car leaves the factory, you test each part individually:
  - Does the door lock? (Pass/Fail)
  - Does the window roll down? (Pass/Fail)
  - Does the engine start? (Pass/Fail)
  
  If one test fails, you don't ship the car.
</AnalogyBox>

## The Test Runner

Run a suite of automated tests. Introduce a "bug" to see what happens when a test fails.

<TestRunner />

### Key Concepts

1.  **Unit Test**: A small piece of code that tests a specific function or method in isolation.
2.  **Assertion**: A statement that checks if a result matches the expectation (e.g., `assert(2 + 2 == 4)`).
3.  **Mocking**: Creating fake objects (like a fake Database) so you can test your code without relying on external systems.

### The Code

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class CalculatorTest {
    
    @Test
    public void shouldAddNumbers() {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        int result = calc.add(2, 3);
        
        // Assertion: Expect 5, get result
        assertEquals(5, result); 
    }
}
```
