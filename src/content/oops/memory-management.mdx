# Memory Management

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  Memory is like a **Restaurant**:
  - **Stack**: The waiter's notepad. Fast, temporary, organized (function calls).
  - **Heap**: The kitchen storage. Large, messy, needs cleaning (objects).
  - **Garbage Collector**: The busboy who clears tables when customers leave.
</AnalogyBox>

## The Garbage Collector

Visualize how objects are stored in the Heap and cleaned up when no longer needed.

<GarbageCollector />

### Key Concepts

1.  **Stack Memory**:
    - Stores primitive variables (`int`, `boolean`) and references to objects.
    - Automatically cleared when a function ends.
    - Very fast access.

2.  **Heap Memory**:
    - Stores actual objects (`new Car()`, `new ArrayList()`).
    - Objects live here until they are "collected".
    - Slower access than Stack.

3.  **Garbage Collection (GC)**:
    - A background process that looks for "unreferenced" objects.
    - If no variable points to an object, it's considered "garbage" and deleted to free up memory.

### The Code

```java
void createObject() {
    // "c" is a reference on the Stack
    // "new Car()" creates an object on the Heap
    Car c = new Car(); 
    
    // ... function ends ...
    // "c" is popped off the Stack.
    // The Car object on the Heap is now unreferenced.
    // GC will eventually delete it.
}
```
