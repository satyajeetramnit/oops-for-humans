# What is Object-Oriented Programming?

<AnalogyBox type="philosophy">
  OOP is not just code. It's a **way of thinking**.
  
  Instead of writing a long list of instructions (Procedural), you model your software after real-world things (Objects).
  
  - A **Car** object has wheels and an engine.
  - A **User** object has a name and a password.
</AnalogyBox>

## The Four Pillars

OOP stands on four massive pillars. If you understand these, you understand OOP.

1.  **Encapsulation**: Keeping secrets.
2.  **Inheritance**: Passing down traits.
3.  **Polymorphism**: Many forms.
4.  **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity.

We will explore each of these in the next lessons!
