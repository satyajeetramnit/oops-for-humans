# Reflection

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  Reflection is like **X-Ray Specs**:
  
  Normally, you can only see the outside of an object (Public methods).
  With Reflection, you can see the inside (Private fields), check what type it is, and even change its internal organs (Data) while it's alive!
</AnalogyBox>

## X-Ray Specs

Inspect a "SecretBox" object to see its private fields, and then hack it!

<XRaySpecs />

### Key Concepts

1.  **Introspection**: The ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime.
2.  **Reflection**: The ability to modify the structure and behavior of the program at runtime.
3.  **Use Cases**:
    - IDEs (Auto-completion)
    - Debuggers
    - Testing Frameworks (JUnit uses reflection to find `@Test` methods)
    - Serialization Libraries (JSON parsers)

### The Code

```java
import java.lang.reflect.*;

class Secret {
    private String password = "123";
}

Secret s = new Secret();
// s.password; // Error! Private access.

// Using Reflection
Field f = s.getClass().getDeclaredField("password");
f.setAccessible(true); // Bypass security!
System.out.println(f.get(s)); // Output: "123"
```
