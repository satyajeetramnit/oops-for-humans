# Design Principles

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  Good design is about **Organization**:
  - **Coupling**: How tangled your headphones are. (High Coupling = Bad, Low Coupling = Good).
  - **Cohesion**: How well-organized your toolbox is. (High Cohesion = Good, Low Cohesion = Bad).
</AnalogyBox>

## Coupling Meter

Visualize the difference between High and Low Coupling.

### Key Concepts

1.  **Coupling**: The degree of dependency between modules.
    - **High Coupling**: Changing one module breaks another. (Spaghetti Code).
    - **Low Coupling**: Modules are independent and communicate via simple interfaces.

2.  **Cohesion**: The degree to which elements inside a module belong together.
    - **High Cohesion**: A class does one thing well (SRP).
    - **Low Cohesion**: A class does everything (God Object).

3.  **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer building objects from smaller parts ("has-a") rather than inheriting from a giant parent ("is-a").

### Composition Over Inheritance
Why favor Composition?
- **Flexibility**: You can change parts at runtime (e.g., swap an Engine).
- **Avoids Fragile Base Class**: Changes in a parent class won't break unrelated children.
- **No Diamond Problem**: Since you don't inherit implementation, you avoid multiple inheritance issues.

**Inheritance (Rigid):**
```java
class Bird { void fly() {} }
class Ostrich extends Bird { /* Can't fly! Inheritance fails here. */ }
```

**Composition (Flexible):**
```java
class Bird {
    FlyingBehavior wings; // Has-A
    
    void setFlyingAbility(FlyingBehavior fb) {
        this.wings = fb;
    }
}
// Ostrich gets NoFlyingAbility, Eagle gets HighFlyingAbility.
```

### The Code

**High Coupling (Bad):**
```java
class Order {
    // Direct dependency on a specific database class
    MySQLDatabase db = new MySQLDatabase(); 
    
    void save() {
        db.insert("orders", this);
    }
}
```

**Low Coupling (Good):**
```java
class Order {
    // Depends on an interface, not a specific class
    Database db;
    
    Order(Database db) {
        this.db = db;
    }
    
    void save() {
        db.insert("orders", this);
    }
}
```
