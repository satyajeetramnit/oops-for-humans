# The Static Keyword

<AnalogyBox type="community">
  **Static** is like a **Town Clock**.
  
  - Everyone in the town looks at the *same* clock.
  - If you change the time on the clock, it changes for *everyone*.
  
  **Non-Static** is like a **Wristwatch**.
  - Everyone has their *own* watch.
  - Changing your watch doesn't affect anyone else.
</AnalogyBox>

## The Global Scoreboard

Imagine a game where all players contribute to a **Team Score**.
- If `score` is **static**, all players share the same score variable.
- If `score` is **not static**, each player has their own private score.

<GlobalScoreboard />

## The Code

Use the `static` keyword to make a variable shared.

  <div lang="Java">
    ```java
    class Player {
        static int teamScore = 0; // Shared!
        int personalScore = 0;    // Not Shared
    }

    Player p1 = new Player();
    Player p2 = new Player();

    p1.teamScore += 10;
    // p2.teamScore is ALSO 10 now!
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="Python">
    ```python
    class Player:
        team_score = 0 # Class Variable (Static)

        def __init__(self):
            self.personal_score = 0 # Instance Variable

    p1 = Player()
    p2 = Player()

    Player.team_score += 10
    # p2.team_score is ALSO 10 now!
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="C++">
    ```cpp
    class Player {
    public:
        static int teamScore; // Declaration
        int personalScore;
    };

    int Player::teamScore = 0; // Definition

    Player p1;
    Player p2;
    p1.teamScore += 10;
    // p2.teamScore is ALSO 10 now!
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    class Player {
        static teamScore: number = 0; // Shared!
        personalScore: number = 0;    // Not Shared
    }

    const p1 = new Player();
    const p2 = new Player();

    Player.teamScore += 10;
    // Player.teamScore is 10 for everyone
    ```
  </div>

## Advanced Concepts

### The Final Keyword
While `static` means "shared", `final` means "unchangeable".
- **Final Variable**: A constant. Once assigned, it cannot be changed.
- **Final Method**: Cannot be overridden by a subclass.
- **Final Class**: Cannot be inherited from.

  <div lang="Java">
    ```java
    class MathConstants {
        // static final = Global Constant
        static final double PI = 3.14159;
    }

    // MathConstants.PI = 3.14; // Error!
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="Python">
    ```python
    # Python doesn't have true constants, but by convention:
    class MathConstants:
        PI = 3.14159 # Uppercase implies constant

    # MathConstants.PI = 3.14 # Possible, but bad practice!
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="C++">
    ```cpp
    class MathConstants {
    public:
        // static const = Global Constant
        static const double PI;
    };

    const double MathConstants::PI = 3.14159;
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    class MathConstants {
        // static readonly = Global Constant
        static readonly PI: number = 3.14159;
    }

    // MathConstants.PI = 3.14; // Error!
    ```
  </div>
