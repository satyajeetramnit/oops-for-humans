# Exception Handling

<AnalogyBox type="safety">
  Exceptions are like **Bombs** ticking in your code.
  
  - If you ignore them, your program **CRASHES** (Explodes).
  - If you use `try-catch`, you are the **Bomb Squad**. You diffuse the bomb safely and the program continues.
</AnalogyBox>

## The Bomb Squad

You have 10 seconds to cut the correct wire.
- **Without Safety**: Cutting the wrong wire crashes the system.
- **With try-catch**: The safety net catches the explosion.

<BombSquad />

## The Code

Wrap dangerous code in a `try` block.

  <div lang="Java">
    ```java
    try {
        cutWire(wire); // Might throw ExplosionException!
    } catch (ExplosionException e) {
        System.out.println("Caught the explosion! We are safe.");
    } finally {
        System.out.println("This runs no matter what.");
    }
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="Python">
    ```python
    try:
        cut_wire(wire) # Might raise ExplosionException!
    except ExplosionException as e:
        print("Caught the explosion! We are safe.")
    finally:
        print("This runs no matter what.")
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="C++">
    ```cpp
    try {
        cutWire(wire); // Might throw ExplosionException!
    } catch (const ExplosionException& e) {
        cout << "Caught the explosion! We are safe." << endl;
    }
    // C++ doesn't have 'finally'. Use RAII (Destructors) for cleanup.
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    try {
        cutWire(wire); // Might throw Error!
    } catch (e) {
        console.log("Caught the explosion! We are safe.");
    } finally {
        console.log("This runs no matter what.");
    }
