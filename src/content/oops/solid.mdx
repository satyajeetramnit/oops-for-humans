# SOLID Principles

<AnalogyBox type="architect">
  SOLID is a set of 5 rules to keep your code clean and maintainable.
  
  Think of it like **Building a House**:
  - You don't want the kitchen sink in the bedroom (**SRP**).
  - You want to be able to add a garage without tearing down the living room (**OCP**).

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should do **one thing** well.
- **Bad**: A `GodBot` that cooks AND cleans.
- **Good**: A `ChefBot` and a `CleanerBot`.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Open for **Extension**, Closed for **Modification**.
- You should be able to add a **Jetpack** to a robot without rewriting the robot's internal code.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
If it looks like a Duck and quacks like a Duck, it should accept batteries... wait, no!
- A **Rubber Duck** cannot replace a **Real Duck** if the code expects it to fly.
