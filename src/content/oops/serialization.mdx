# Serialization

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  Serialization is like **Freezing Food**:
  
  - **Serialize**: You take a fresh meal (Object), freeze it (Convert to Bytes/JSON), and ship it across the world.
  - **Deserialize**: The receiver takes the frozen package and heats it up (Reconstructs the Object) to eat it.
</AnalogyBox>

## The Freeze Ray

Turn a live Hero object into static data (JSON or Binary) to save it or send it over a network.

<FreezeRay />

### Key Concepts

1.  **Serialization**: Converting an object's state into a byte stream or text format (like JSON or XML).
    - Used for: Saving to files, sending over networks (APIs), caching.

2.  **Deserialization**: The reverse process—recreating the object from the serialized data.

3.  **Security Warning**: Never deserialize data from untrusted sources! It's like eating food you found on the street—it might contain a virus (literally).

### The Code

```java
import java.io.*;

class Hero implements Serializable {
    String name = "SuperDev";
}

// Serialize (Freeze)
FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream("hero.ser");
ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut);
out.writeObject(new Hero());
out.close();

// Deserialize (Thaw)
FileInputStream fileIn = new FileInputStream("hero.ser");
ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(fileIn);
Hero h = (Hero) in.readObject();
in.close();
```
