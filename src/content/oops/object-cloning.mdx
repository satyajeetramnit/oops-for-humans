# Object Cloning

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  Cloning is like **Photocopying**:
  
  - **Shallow Copy**: You photocopy the main page, but if there's a sticky note attached, you just point to the same sticky note. If someone writes on the sticky note, both copies see it.
  - **Deep Copy**: You photocopy the main page AND the sticky note. Now you have two completely separate sets.
</AnalogyBox>

## The Cloning Machine

See the difference between Shallow and Deep Copy when we mutate shared data (DNA).

### Key Concepts

1.  **Shallow Copy**: Creates a new object, but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
    - Fast, but risky if mutable objects are shared.
    - Default behavior of `Object.clone()` in Java.

2.  **Deep Copy**: Creates a new object and recursively copies everything found in the original.
    - Slower, but safer. The two objects are fully independent.

### The Code

```java
class Sheep implements Cloneable {
    String name;
    DNA dna; // A mutable object

    // Shallow Copy (Default)
    public Object clone() {
        return super.clone(); 
    }
    
    // Deep Copy (Manual)
    public Sheep deepClone() {
        Sheep copy = new Sheep();
        copy.name = this.name;
        copy.dna = new DNA(this.dna.code); // New object!
        return copy;
    }
}
```
