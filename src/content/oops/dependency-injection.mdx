# Dependency Injection

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  Dependency Injection (DI) is like **Changing Batteries**:
  
  You don't solder a battery into a remote control. You provide a slot so you can swap batteries (AA, AAA, Rechargeable) easily.
  
  The remote doesn't care *which* battery it is, as long as it fits.
</AnalogyBox>

## The Injector

Inject different engines into the car. The car works with any engine because it depends on the *interface*, not the specific implementation.

<InjectorArm />

### Key Concepts

1.  **Dependency**: An object that another object needs to function (e.g., Car needs an Engine).
2.  **Injection**: Passing the dependency from the outside (via constructor or setter) rather than creating it inside.
3.  **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Giving control of dependency creation to a framework or caller.

### The Code

**Without DI (Bad):**
<CodeSwitcher>
  <div lang="Java">
    ```java
    class Car {
        private GasEngine engine;
        
        Car() {
            engine = new GasEngine(); // Hardcoded! Can't use ElectricEngine.
        }
    }
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="Python">
    ```python
    class Car:
        def __init__(self):
            self.engine = GasEngine() # Hardcoded!
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="C++">
    ```cpp
    class Car {
        GasEngine engine;
    public:
        Car() {
            // Engine created automatically or hardcoded here
        }
    };
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    class Car {
        private engine: GasEngine;
        constructor() {
            this.engine = new GasEngine(); // Hardcoded!
        }
    }
    ```
  </div>
</CodeSwitcher>

**With DI (Good):**
<CodeSwitcher>
  <div lang="Java">
    ```java
    class Car {
        private Engine engine;
        
        // Inject via Constructor
        Car(Engine e) {
            this.engine = e; // Flexible! Can be Gas, Electric, or Hybrid.
        }
    }
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="Python">
    ```python
    class Car:
        # Inject via Constructor (__init__)
        def __init__(self, engine):
            self.engine = engine # Flexible!
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="C++">
    ```cpp
    class Car {
        Engine* engine;
    public:
        // Inject via Constructor
        Car(Engine* e) : engine(e) {} // Flexible!
    };
    ```
  </div>
  <div lang="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    class Car {
        private engine: Engine;
        
        // Inject via Constructor
        constructor(engine: Engine) {
            this.engine = engine; // Flexible!
        }
    }
    ```
  </div>
</CodeSwitcher>
