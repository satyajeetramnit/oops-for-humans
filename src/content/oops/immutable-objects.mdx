# Immutable Objects

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  Immutable Objects are like **Diamonds**:
  
  Once formed, they cannot be changed. If you want a different shape, you have to cut a **new** diamond. You can't just mold the old one like clay.

## The Shielded Vault

Try to modify the content of the Vault. Since it's immutable, you can't! You have to create a new one.

### Key Concepts

1.  **Immutability**: An object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.
2.  **Benefits**:
    - **Thread Safety**: No need for locks because data never changes.
    - **Security**: No one can secretly modify your data.
    - **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and debug.
3.  **Examples**: `String` in Java, `tuple` in Python.

### The Code

How to make a class immutable in Java:
1.  Make the class `final` (so no one can extend it).
2.  Make all fields `private` and `final`.
3.  Don't provide "Setters".
4.  Initialize everything in the Constructor.

```java
final class ImmutablePoint {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;

    public ImmutablePoint(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int getX() { return x; }
    public int getY() { return y; }
    // No setX() or setY()!
}
```
