# Type System

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  Type Casting is like **Disguises**:
  
  - **Upcasting**: A Doctor puts on a generic "Human" mask. They are still a Doctor, but you only treat them as a Human. (Safe).
  - **Downcasting**: You ask the "Human" to take off the mask. If they really ARE a Doctor, great! If they are actually a Firefighter, you have a problem. (Unsafe).

## The Transformer

See how objects can be viewed as their Parent type (Upcasting) or cast back to their specific type (Downcasting).

<TypeTransformer />

### Key Concepts

1.  **Upcasting**: Treating a Child object as a Parent object.
    - Always safe.
    - `Shape s = new Circle();`

2.  **Downcasting**: Treating a Parent reference as a Child object.
    - Risky! Requires a check.
    - `Circle c = (Circle) s;`

3.  **Type Checking**: Using `instanceof` (Java) or `typeof` to verify the object before casting.

### The Code

```java
class Shape {}
class Circle extends Shape { void roll() {} }
class Square extends Shape { void slide() {} }

// Upcasting (Safe)
Shape s = new Circle(); 

// Downcasting (Risky)
if (s instanceof Circle) {
    Circle c = (Circle) s; // Safe now!
    c.roll();
} else {
    System.out.println("Not a Circle!");
}

// Bad Downcast
Square sq = (Square) s; // Error! ClassCastException.
```
