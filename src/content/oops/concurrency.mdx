# Concurrency

<AnalogyBox type="concept">
  Concurrency is like a **Kitchen with Multiple Chefs**:
  - **Threads**: The chefs working in parallel.
  - **Shared Resource**: The single oven they all need to use.
  - **Race Condition**: Two chefs trying to put a pizza in the oven at the exact same time (chaos!).
  - **Lock**: A rule saying "Only one chef can use the oven at a time".
</AnalogyBox>

## The Thread Race

Visualize two threads running in parallel and accessing a shared resource.

<ThreadRace />

### Key Concepts

1.  **Thread**: A lightweight unit of execution. A program can have multiple threads running simultaneously.
2.  **Race Condition**: A bug that happens when multiple threads try to change shared data at the same time. The result depends on who "wins" the race.
3.  **Synchronization (Lock)**: A mechanism to ensure only one thread can access a resource at a time, preventing race conditions.

### The Code

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // "synchronized" acts as a Lock
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}

// Two threads calling increment() at the same time
// Without "synchronized", count might be wrong!
```
